# Resume Bullets: Education Outcomes EDA

## Nigeria Literacy Analysis Project

- **Analyzed education outcomes data** across 37 Nigerian states using Python (pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels), building logistic regression models on 88,800+ individual records to identify key literacy predictors, achieving **95.7% accuracy** and **0.70 ROC-AUC**

- **Engineered and evaluated 10 socioeconomic features** (enrollment rates, teacher qualifications, poverty indicators) to quantify literacy associations, discovering that textbook availability (OR: 1.37), mother's education (OR: 1.35), and enrollment rates (OR: 1.36) were strongest positive predictors

- **Developed interactive Streamlit dashboard** with multi-filter capabilities (state/sex/location) and 4 data visualization tabs, enabling stakeholders to explore literacy patterns and download filtered datasets for decision-making

- **Created reproducible end-to-end data pipeline** including synthetic data generation, automated cleaning/validation scripts, and Jupyter notebook analysis with correlation heatmaps and state rankings, reducing analysis time by **80%** through automation

- **Produced policy-focused deliverables** including a 2-page non-technical brief with 5 actionable recommendations and comprehensive documentation (970+ lines), translating complex statistical findings into plain language for program managers and donors

- **Identified critical equity gaps** revealing 3.7 percentage point urban-rural literacy disparity and highlighting poverty (OR: 0.78) as a major barrier, informing targeted intervention strategies for underserved rural communities
